To add a mirror we need the answers to the following questions to proceed:
* What bandwidth does your server have? Where is it located?
* What is the url of "our" mirror? (Please make it available under /endeavouros if possible)
* How much disk space are we allowed to occupy? 
* Do you offer public rsync access and if yes, what's the rsync "url"?
* Who is hosting the mirror?
* We plan to have a list of all mirrors and the sponsors in the future, what website should we link for that mirror? And what Sponsor Name?
* Can we use the mirror for both? ISO and repo?

Needed specifications and services:

1. Over 100 Mbits

2. IPV4 (In addition, also ask whether IPV6 is also included)
 
3. Must not be behind Cloudflare or similar

4. Sync with rsync every 3 hours on a random minute from alpix.eu.rsync.endeavouros.com::endeavouros

5. Sync with Rsync every hour on a random minute (also ask how often and whether syncing is done on a random minute)
